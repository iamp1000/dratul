## now what i want you to do is very improtant for this project okay so what we want to do is read the todo go and not make changes but understand each baby step and the read the files to check that if that logic already exists or it needs to updated or added from scratch and then mark it done 
## this is a previous todo of mine which i made alot of progress to but i want you to verify that everything is working correctly or some curropt part of the code was manually removed by my team since it was not upto the standards okay 
## so read file read dir list dir edit file tools to first understand the project structure and then under stand what the files contain and then proceed with the todo task i just gave you okay 

## General Notes (EDIT TEST)
- Make all changes without deleting existing code.
- Only edit files to make necessary modifications to avoid accidental code removal.
- Ensure all changes are fully backward-compatible with existing appointment and patient functionality.
- Based on all the changes we are making always look for contrasting code in the backend or front end which   can cause possible errors and prevent the app from running
- Read the project files for context starting with all the files in app folder for backend and root folder has front end html code
