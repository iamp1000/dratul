## now what i want you to do is very improtant for this project okay so what we want to do is read the todo go and not make changes but understand each baby step and the read the files to check that if that logic already exists or it needs to updated or added from scratch and then mark it done 
## this is a previous todo of mine which i made alot of progress to but i want you to verify that everything is working correctly or some curropt part of the code was manually removed by my team since it was not upto the standards okay 
## so read file read dir list dir edit file tools to first understand the project structure and then under stand what the files contain and then proceed with the todo task i just gave you okay 

## General Notes (EDIT TEST)
- Make all changes without deleting existing code.
- Only edit files to make necessary modifications to avoid accidental code removal.
- Ensure all changes are fully backward-compatible with existing appointment and patient functionality.
- Based on all the changes we are making always look for contrasting code in the backend or front end which   can cause possible errors and prevent the app from running
- Read the project files for context starting with all the files in app folder for backend and root folder has front end html code

## Appointment Form Modifications
- [x] Modify appointment form to allow creating patients with required fields: first name, last name, DOB, date and time for appointment, city.
- [x] Add manual name entry with algorithm suggesting patients from past database entries based on letters entered.
- [x] For existing patients, build suggestion algorithm in the appointment form.
- [x] Create form section for choosing existing patient (select date/time).

- [x] Add fields for first name and last name.
- [x] Add optional location field for city.
- [x] Add field for date of birth (DOB).
- [x] Add optional reason for visit field.
- [x] Make first name, DOB, date, and time required.

- [x] Add field for appointment date, defaulting to today or next available day.
- [x] Show available hours for selected date.
- [x] Add constraint to prevent double-booking or walk-in overbooking (limit online appointments). (Backend validation for 15-min intervals and duration is now enforced)
- [x] Ensure default 15-minute gap between appointments. (Backend validation for 15-min intervals and duration is now enforced)
- [x] Add ability to manually block online bookings for a day (hospital/home/clinic).
- [ ] Build schedule section with default/modifiable hour slots and "off" days.

## Backend and Data Handling
- [x] Check expected backend appointment data: time, date, patient info, all optional fields.
- [x] Review database for patient appointment fields required.
- [x] Update backend and DB logic for compatibility.
- [ ] Implement logic to:
- [x] Check doctor's available hours before booking.

- [x] Disallow appointment overlaps; maintain 10â€“15 min minimum gap.
- [x] Link doctor schedule/availability to Google Calendar. (busy-time checks added to availability and booking)
- [x] Add function for manual slot blocking in backend.
- [ ] Match backend validations to frontend constraints for data integrity.

## Frontend Schedule and Calendar
- [ ] Convert frontend schedule to calendar view styled like Appointment tab.
- [ ] Link calendar to Google Calendar with dedicated button.
- [ ] Show daily schedules per date.
- [ ] Display available hours based on backend and Google Calendar.
- [ ] Edit only by adding/incremental change; don't delete code.

## Appointment Booking Algorithm
- [ ] Add time and date fields to appointments with 15-minute default gap.
- [ ] Build appointment booking algorithm to:
- [x] Check doctor availability for chosen slot.
- [x] Enforce gaps and booking limits. (interval configurable; daily limit configurable)
- [ ] Honor walk-in reservations and manual appointment blocks. (Manual blocks honored; walk-in reservation logic pending)
- [x] Adjust schedule logic so appointments always obey rules.

## Gmail Calendar Integration
- [x] Integrate Gmail calendar into backend schedules (busy checks wired).
- [x] Block appointments based on Google Calendar "Busy" slots.
- [x] Ensure backend can't book during Google Calendar busy times.
- [x] Treat Google Calendar as final source for availability (fail-open if API errors).

- [ ] Add word-editor-like UI for prescription writing. (Backend endpoints added; UI integration pending)
- [x] Allow doctors to create new prescriptions.
- [x] Enable inserting prescriptions into patient records.
- [ ] Add options for prescription email or WhatsApp sending. (Backend sharing + logs exist; UI pending)
- [ ] Add print button for prescriptions. (PDF streaming endpoint added; UI button pending)

## Patient Database and SPA Instructions
- [x] Build patient tab in frontend listing all patients.
- [x] Implement opening any patient from appointment or patient tab.
- [ ] When a patient is opened:
- [ ] Show all patient details (name, DOB, city, contact info, etc.) (Composite backend endpoint added; UI pending)
- [x] Add option to write remarks for patient record.
- [ ] Enable direct creation of prescriptions from patient view.
- [x] Show last prescriptions with details.
- [ ] Allow editing/saving patient details with validation. (Backend update endpoint added; UI pending)
- [ ] Sync all SPA changes with backend/database (preserve unrelated data).

## New Tasks & Improvements
- [x] Implement Audit Log viewer with a dedicated tab.
- [ ] Fix appointment modal overflow UI bug.
- [ ] Improve validation error messages to specify exact fields.
- [x] Implement backend for doctor schedule (working hours, days off).
- [ ] Create frontend UI to edit/manage doctor schedules.
- [ ] Link appointment form to live schedule data (replace mock).
- [x] Block bookings outside available schedule/gaps.
- [x] Add detailed availability endpoint with reasons for UI.
- [x] Add schedule config endpoints (interval and daily limit) + wire into booking.

## Additional Tasks from Testing
- [ ] Fix appointment form field overflow; prevent content being hidden.
- [ ] Build schedule section so appointments use schedule-picked times.
- [ ] In existing patient tab, improve error handling to mention only missing field, not all fields.
- [ ] Add new tasks at bottom of todo.md; keep previous tasks.
- [ ] Track tasks you add or are requested, never remove original items.

## Next Steps: Unified Schedule View
- [ ] Unify calendar display for hospital/home clinic
- [x] Modify DoctorSchedule to fetch both schedules.
- [ ] Merge schedules into single data structure.
- [x] Update ScheduleCalendar to show both locations' hours together.
- [ ] Remove hospital/clinic location tabs.

- [x] Add backend POST /api/v1/unavailable-periods for UnavailablePeriod entries.
- [x] On calendar date click, open simple modal (DailyUnavailabilityEditor).
- [ ] Modal lets user mark day unavailable for either/both Hospital and Home Clinic.
- [ ] Fetch/display UnavailablePeriod data and override weekly schedule on calendar.

## Immediate Debugging/Rate Limiting Tasks
- [ ] Review app/limiter.py and identify where DummyLimiter is used.
- [ ] Note DummyLimiter is only a placeholder and doesn't enforce rate limits.
- [ ] Decide to defer actual rate limiting to get app running now.
- [ ] Add a todo.md task for implementing rate limiting logic later.
- [x] Read app/main.py code to debug startup errors.
- [x] Investigate what startup errors occur.
- [x] Identify/document causes of startup errors.
- [x] Fix each startup error one by one.
- [x] Test changes to verify that the application starts up correctly.

now currently it says that only whatsapp and email services are online where the google calendar is offline even though i have the calendar_credentials in the project and what i want you  to do is check why the google calendar is offline and then proceed to making listed changes to the system status 

1 whatsap and email should have a service suffix added with calendar haivn the same

2 change the size of the system status to smaller supposendly to col-3 with a name and green or red dot in front indicating if working or not 

3 add a backend and databse connection tab as well to indicate the backend and databse are connected and working fine and whatsapp should not show connected but rather show if the whatsapp bot we are trying to create is working or not get me ?
