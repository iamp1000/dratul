## Backend Recovery Plan

### Phase 1: Assessment and Verification
- [ ] **Step 1.1: Full Project Scan**
  - [ ] Read all files in the `app` directory to get a complete picture of the current state of the code.
- [ ] **Step 1.2: Obtain Last Safe Code**
  - [ ] I will ask you to provide the last known good version of the backend files. Please place them in a new directory called `last_safe_code`.
- [ ] **Step 1.3: Compare and Identify Missing Components**
  - [ ] I will compare the current backend files with the last known good version to identify missing functions, classes, and other components.

### Phase 2: Recovery and Integration
- [ ] **Step 2.1: Merge and Restore**
  - [ ] I will merge the missing components from the last known good version into the current files, being careful not to overwrite any new features.
- [ ] **Step 2.2: Fix Integration Errors**
  - [ ] I will fix any import errors or other issues that arise from the merge.

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] **Step 3.1: Test Application Startup**
  - [ ] I will ask you to run the application again to confirm that all startup errors are resolved.
- [ ] **Step 3.2: Continue with `todo.md`**
  - [ ] Once the app is running, I will continue with the verification and completion of the tasks in the main `todo.md` file.
